# RNG
  - *Middle Square*: Takes a positive integer and returns the middle digits of its square. A 'bad' pseudorandom generator.
  - *Algorithm K*: Another 'bad' pseudorandom generator, see Knuth, AOCP v2, pg 5.
  - *Period*: Determines the period of a recursively generated sequence in O(1) space, e.g. finding the period of a linear congruential generator.
